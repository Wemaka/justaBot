# justaBot
It's just a bot for Discord using Java, Spring Boot, JPA, Postgres

To run locally, you will need to change the variables **(they look like ${})** in `docker-compose.yml` and `application.properties` to your own. Then go to the docker folder and run these commands:
```console
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
